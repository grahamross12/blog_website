# News Website
For my final project in CS50 I have created a news website with Flask. This website uses NewsAPI to find information about news articles from a number of different websites and display them in a user friendly format using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap elements. I made the project outside the CS50 IDE using Sublime Text and a Python virtual environment, and I have hosted it on Heroku. While developing the project, I found it useful to use Git and Github save working versions of the code while working on new features.<br>
The main backend part of the website is written in app.py and contains the Flask routes for the different pages in the website.
